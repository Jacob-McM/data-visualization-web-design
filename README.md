# Showcasing data visualizations with HTML and CSS

This repo contains the file and folder structure for a showcase website that displays data visualizations gathered during a [previous project](https://github.com/Jacob-McM/weather-from-api). In the this repo you will find:

|HTML files|Description|
|----------|-----------|
|[index](index.html)|This is the HTML file for the [homepage](https://jacob-mcm.github.io/data-visualization-web-design/) of the website. Built utilizing Bootstrap.|
|[data](data.html)|This is the HTML file for the [data](https://jacob-mcm.github.io/data-visualization-web-design/data.html) page of the website. Contains a table with all the data used to build the visualizations. The table was exported from pandas to html format.|   
|[comparisons](comparisons.html)|This is the HTML file for the [comparisons](https://jacob-mcm.github.io/data-visualization-web-design/comparison.html) page of the website. Contains a grid of the visualizations either as a side-by-side 2x2 or a 1x4 ladder depending on the user relative screen size.
|[plots](/visualizations/)| Found in the visualizations folder are 4 html files, [fig1](https://jacob-mcm.github.io/data-visualization-web-design/visualizations/fig1.html), [fig2](https://jacob-mcm.github.io/data-visualization-web-design/visualizations/fig2.html), [fig3](https://jacob-mcm.github.io/data-visualization-web-design/visualizations/fig3.html), and [fig4](https://jacob-mcm.github.io/data-visualization-web-design/visualizations/fig4.html). Each is a page showcasing the plot with 1-2 paragraphs of analysis of the plot.|

The folders found in this repo are:

|[Resources](/Resources/)|File Description|
|-------------------------------|----------------|
|[Weather Data](weather_data.csv)|A csv that contains the datasource originally used to the build the visualizations found on the website.|
|[weather_tables](weather_table.html)|An html file that was exported from pandas. Is an HTML table of the weather_data.csv|

|[Assets](/assets/)|File Description|
|-------------------------|----------------|
|[style](style.css)| In the assets folder is the css folder, which contains the style.css file. This file was used for minor adjustments across the website.|
|[images](/assets/images/)| A folder containing the image source files of the visualizations found on the website. Created and exported using Matplotlib.|

Also found is the [Visualizations Folder](/visualizations/) which was linked above in the HTML files for the plots, as it contains all the plot HTML files.

## What is this project?

This project is a website showcase of the data visualization capabilities of HTML and CSS. A website is a very handy tool for actually presenting the data and visualizations you have created. Having a website for oneself is also a good way of displaying a portfollio of what you are capable of. That was the motivation behind this project. 

Specifically showcased here are weather data visualizations that were gathered from a previous project in working with API calls to build a dataset. You can find that project in my repo named [weather-from-api](https://github.com/Jacob-McM/weather-from-api)
